Location: Describe the location.
Characters:
a. Identity: Who is this character, is the character first person or some side character.
b. Action: Describe the action.
c. Words: Write the words that the character says, or this could be inner dialogue if the main character is not saying anything. 
d. Emotion: Describe the emotion.
e. Enter: Enter time in minutes and seconds.
f. Time: How long the character stays in minutes and seconds..
g. Exit: Exit time in minutes and seconds.

Use this format to write the script for the following plot:
There was a new all-you-can-eat restaurant that opened near my home. I went and tried it, it was so good! But now I really feel like throwing up.

Important Instructions:
1. You must strictly follow the script format provided.
2. Make each scene at most 5 seconds long.
3. If multiple characters appear on screen simultaneously, ensure their Enter and Exit times overlap.
4. Always put the script for the main character, or first person, above everyone else.
5. Do not say anything other than giving the script.
6. Do not use any words like 'inner diagloe' even if it is inner thoughts.
7. The first Enter time of the next scene has to match the last Exit time of the last scene so there are no gaps.
